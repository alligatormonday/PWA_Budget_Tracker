  ## Description: 
A PWA application that lets a user track their budget. Users can add funds or subtract funds. If a user doesn't have access to the internet, this application will still allow them to input their information. Then once they have online access again, their input will have been received and the data sent during offline use will still be visualized and saved. 

This application utilizes MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, and Node.js.
